first create dynamic webproject and add jar files hibernate required,servlet-api.jar,ojdbc6.jar
and database connection with eclipse
and come from database
hibernate configuration.xml
entity class
configure entity class into xml
and we will create InsertEmployeedata class for inserting record
we dont need to call configure() and buildsessionFctory() every time so we need to write another class...by using singleton design pattern.
name HibernateUtility
and next create servlet for capture the data  from the html file. 
and create html file.
